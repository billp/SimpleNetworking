{"id":24,"name":"Athens","description":"Athens is the historical capital of Europe, with a long history, dating from the first settlement in the Neolithic age. In the 5th Century BC (the “Golden Age of Pericles”) – the culmination of Athens’ long, fascinating history – the city’s values and civilization acquired a universal significance. Over the years, a multitude of conquerors occupied Athens, and erected unique, splendid monuments - a rare historical palimpsest. In 1834, it became the capital of the modern Greek state and in two centuries since it has become an attractive modern metropolis with unrivalled charm.","country_name":"Greece","image":"/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBKQT09IiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--687bfb28cf56ed645dce2477dd4f1dba75a6622b/athens.jpg"}
